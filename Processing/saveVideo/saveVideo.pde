/* This program will save a sequence of images in a "movie" folder.
    To convert these to an image, use Processing's Movie Maker tool in "Tools" > "Movie Maker".
    
    Note from Processing: 
    Movie Maker â€“ the MovieMaker class has been removed, because it was specific to QuickTime for Java. 
    In its place there is now a Movie Maker item under the Tools menu, 
    that helps you convert a file of frames into a video file. 
    There isn't a good library-based method to make this work, 
    so it'll probably stay a Tool rather than be re-incorporated into the video library.
