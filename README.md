Bukkit:

In this repo, there are files that relate to the Bukkit Project (http://forums.bukkit.org/pages/about-us/). The files are extensive server modifications to the popular game called "Minecraft". It utilizes de-obfuscated Java code in order to allow modifications to how the game works, server-side. The GeneralPermissions project is the most recent project, in the works for a few months, and is still currently being worked on and improved. This project gives and removes permissions, allowing or denying players from doing specific actions in the game. The other project Kadmin, consists of administrative tools for the server operators to be able to fluidly and efficiently patrol the server and fix issues that arise. This project also holds some tools that normal users can utilize.


Processing:

In this repo, there are files related to an academic project related to graphics/image processing that are written in the language called Processing. Processing is based off of Java with other additions specifically related to graphical/audio/video processing. In this project, a team of 5 worked together to create a program that recognizes specific colors, and chooses the most pronounced object.
